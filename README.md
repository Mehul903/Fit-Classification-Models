# Fit-Classification-Models

This repository contains code to apply some of the most widely used Supervised Machine Learning classification algorithms on data. 
The directory `class` contains _**SupervisedModels.py**_ and this is the script which fits models on the data. Another script,
_**test_script.py**_, in the same directory shows an example of how to use this module.

**data** contains the dataset used to perform some tests. Data source is this [link](https://www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning/).

## Near-future scope of this project:

1. Generalized code for both: Numpy-matrix and Pandas-dataframe
2. Summary plots for all the models
3. Few functions to do data pre-processing before fitting the models

- Currently, to use this module, one needs to preprocess the data manually. I intend to automate that process up to some extent.

- Possible functions for: Encoding and Scaling features

### Feel free to contribute!!
