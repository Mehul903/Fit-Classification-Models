# Fit-Classification-Models

This repository contains code to apply some of the most widely used Supervised Machine Learning classification algorithms on data, 
namely Logistic-Regression, Random-Forest, and Support-Vector-Classifier. 
The directory `class` contains _**SupervisedModels.py**_ and this is the script which fits models on the data, and generates 
simple summary statistics for each fitted model. Another script, _**test_script.py**_, in the same directory shows an example 
of how to use this module. A Jupyter Notebook is also available for examples.

**data** contains the dataset used to perform some tests. Data source is this [link](https://www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning/).

## Near-future scope of this project:

1. Generalized code for various input data formats: Dataframes, numpy-matries, sparse matrices etc.,
2. Simple summary plots for all the models,
3. Partially automate the data pre-processing before fitting the models. This may include dealing with missing values, 
feature transformations etc.
